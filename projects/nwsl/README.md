# An nwsl CLI tool

I want a CLI tool that can be used to determine the number of National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) players coming from each college soccer program.

To create a Python program that determines the number of National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) players coming from each college soccer program, you’ll need to follow a series of steps to organize and analyze the relevant data. Here’s a basic outline of how you could go about creating such a program:

Step 1: Gather the Data
First, you need data on NWSL players and their respective college programs. This could include names of players, the colleges they attended, and perhaps years of attendance if you need more detailed analysis.

Step 2: Organize the Data
Once you have the data, it should be organized in a structured format, such as a CSV file or a database. A CSV file might have columns for Player Name, College, and Year.

Step 3: Load the Data into Python
You can use Python’s pandas library to load and manipulate your data. Install pandas if you haven’t already:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas
Step 4: Write the Program
Here’s a sample Python program using pandas to determine the number of NWSL players from each college:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load data from CSV
df = pd.read_csv('nwsl_players.csv')

# Count the number of players from each college
college_counts = df['College'].value_counts()

# Print the results
print(college_counts)
Explanation:
Loading the Data: The program starts by importing pandas and loading the data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.
Counting Players by College: It uses the value_counts() method on the 'College' column to count the number of occurrences of each college, which corresponds to the number of players from each college.
Displaying Results: Finally, it prints out the counts.
Step 5: Enhance and Test
Depending on the availability and reliability of your data, you might need to clean or preprocess it (e.g., handling missing values, standardizing college names). Test the program with different datasets to ensure it works reliably.

Additional Features
If needed, you can add more features to your program, such as:

Sorting the output to see which colleges produce the most players.
Adding filters to analyze data for specific years or other criteria.
Visualizing the data using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn.
If you have specific data or additional requirements, I can help you adjust the program accordingly.
